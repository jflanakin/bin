# Bash Scripts
## Scripting with style

This is a collection of bash scripts that I've written or open source scripts which I've copied or modified as needed. 

Scripts in the [interactive folder](https://github.com/jflanakin/bash-scripts/interactive) will all be single use scripts for a specific purpose which require user interaction, or would be made better with user interaction.

Scripts in the [non-interactive folder](https://github.com/jflanakin/bash-scripts/non-interactive) will all be simple enough to run as single user scripts that don't need any user interaction or scripts which are meant to run automatically under some process (cron, init scripts, etc).

Scripts in the [projects folder](https://github.com/jflanakin/bash-scripts/projects) are individual projects that are larger than just one script. These projects are often over-complicated and used as practice by me but do contain useful things.

Scripts in the [not-mine folder](https://github.com/jflanakin/bash-scripts/not-mine) are not written by me. These scripts are mostly here for reference. Each will have their sources linked and are under either an MIT license or GNU GPLv3 license. I keep them here for reference while I'm working. It's much easier to reference a local file.
